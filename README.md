## üìö Project Overview

This repository contains an exploratory data analysis project on the **Major Safety Events** dataset from [data.transportation.gov](https://data.transportation.gov/Public-Transit/Major-Safety-Events/9ivb-8ae9/about_data). Our goal is to explore and analyze public transit safety incidents, uncover patterns, and build predictive models.

### üîç Research Questions

- **Regression:**  
  Do factors like time of day, weather conditions, and type of transit service predict the severity of safety incidents (e.g., number of injuries or fatalities)?

- **Classification:**  
  What factors are most predictive of a major safety incident occurring?

## Data Description ##
This dataset consolidates transit-safety reports from multiple agencies. Each record captures essential details such as date, time, location, involved vehicles, environmental conditions, and the severity of injuries and fatalities. Combining these data points offers a comprehensive view of transit incidents and provides opportunities for analysis on vehicle operations, safety measures, passenger risk, and other critical factors that can inform decision-making and research on transit system improvements.
