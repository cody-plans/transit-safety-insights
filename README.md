As part of the Machine Learning Certificate program at the University of Toronto‚Äôs Data Science Institute, this project allowed us to apply the skills and knowledge gained throughout the program to a real-world problem. We focused on analyzing major safety events within U.S. transit systems to uncover key risk factors and generate actionable insights. This end-to-end project involved data preparation, applying machine learning techniques, and delivering findings to support informed decision-making for stakeholders aiming to enhance transit safety nationwide.

## Business Case ##
Transportation is the backbone of our communities - it connects peoples to jobs, services and our loved ones. A safe, reliable and efficient transit system supports public safety, boosts the economy and improves everyday life for everyone. In the United States alone, over 98,000 major safety events were reported between 2014 - 2024. To ensure the safety of all those making their daily travels on the transit systems in the US, this project seeks to uncover the key predictors of major safety incidents that occur. Our goal is to support data-driven decisions for stakeholders such as Public Safety Organizations, Transit Authorities, and City Planners by identifying patterns and risk factors that contribute to serious safety events. The data that was used in our analysis are for non-rail safety events which are a substet of [Major Safety Events](https://data.transportation.gov/Public-Transit/Major-Safety-Events/9ivb-8ae9/about_data) maintained by the Federal Transit Administration (FTA)

### üîç Research Questions
What factors are most predictive of a major safety incident occurring?

To address this, we will implement classification models to determine which variables most strongly indicate the likelihood of a major incident. Time permitting, we may also explore regression models to analyze incident severity or frequency. Techniques such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA) will be employed to reduce dimensionality and improve model performance.

The dataset used in this analysis is sourced from the U.S. Department of Transportation and contains records of major safety events from 2014 to 2024.

### Objectives
- Identify critical factors leading to major non-rail safety incidents
- Inform safety improvements and resource deployment
- Support planning to minimize transit disruptions and improve public safety

### Assumptions & Risks
- Dataset has sufficient quality and structure to train accurate models
- Risk of incomplete or missing data that could affect predictive accuracy
- No unstructured data is currently being processed that could enhance the model

## Data Description ##
The dataset is sourced from the National Transit Database (NTD), which collects Safety and Security (S&S) event data from U.S. transit agencies. Reporting is mandatory for:

- Urban transit agencies operating more than 30 vehicles in maximum service
- All agencies providing rail transit services

These agencies submit:
- Individual reports for major safety events
- Monthly summaries of non-major events by transit mode

### Event Types Captured
The dataset includes a wide range of reportable safety incidents, such as:
- Collisions (vehicle, pedestrian, etc.)
- Fires requiring suppression
- Derailments (mainline and yard, including non-revenue vehicles)
- Hazardous material spills
- Natural disasters (Acts of God)
- Other significant events that meet reporting thresholds (excluding single-person medical transport)

### Reporting Thresholds
Events are reported based on specific criteria, including:
- Fatalities (including suicides), confirmed within 30 days
- Injuries requiring immediate transport from the scene
- Property damage of $25,000 or more
- Evacuations for life-safety reasons
- Significant collisions, especially those involving:
   - Injuries or fatalities
   - Towing of vehicles
   - Suicides or attempts involving transit vehicles

### Definition of a Major Safety Event
For the purpose of this project, a major safety event is defined as any incident that involves at least one of the following:
- A fatality
- An injury (any type)
- Property damage ‚â• $25,000 USD

## Findings ##
### Model Evaluation
Extra Trees outperformed Bagging Classifier and Random Forest, likely due to its more reliable feature selection and ability to avoid overfitting. Extra Trees achieved the highest ROC-AUC score (0.87) compared to 0.81 for the Bagging Classifier and Random Forest 0.67. This stronger performance may be attributed to Extra Trees‚Äô randomized split selection strategy which tends to reduce variance and overfitting particularly with complex data or imbalance datasets. Random Forest has the lowest ROC-AUC score of the three models, likely due to overfitting or its inability to address the dataset‚Äôs complexity.

The differences in feature importance across the models arise in how they handle feature selection, data complexity, correlated features and overfitting.

- Extra Trees (‚ÄúExtremely Randomized Trees‚Äù) selects both features and split thresholds at random. This additional randomness lowers variance. This often results in a more balanced and less biased distribution of feature importance, helping uncover predictive features that other models may overlook
- Random Forest builds trees using random subsets of features at each split which can lead to overemphasis on correlated features. It is more sensitive to feature redundancy and my prioritize less informative features due to randomness in feature selection
- Bagging Classifier trains decision trees on different bootstrap samples, typically using all features at each split (unless otherwise specified). This results in more stable feature importance by producing more correlated trees. We tuned the Bagging Classifier using a grid search and applied class_weight = ‚Äòbalanced‚Äô in the base estimator to address the datasets‚Äô imbalance (with only ~5% of samples belonging to the minority class). Stratified sampling was used during cross-validation to maintain class proportions throughout training and evaluation - mitigating bias towards the majority class

Imbalanced settings, Extra Trees may provide more robust performance by identifying stronger predictors for the minority class. While Bagging and Random Forest can perform well, they are more prone to bias towards the majority class unless corrective measures (like class weights or resampling) are applied.
	
When discussing feature importance, impurity-based models (used by the three in our project) can be biased, particularly in the case of irrelevant or correlated features. As an alternative, permutation importance could be used to evaluate feature importance. It evaluates the decrease in a model‚Äôs importance when a feature‚Äôs values are randomly shuffled - it is less prone to biases caused by impurity-based methods in models. Importance derived from impurity-based methods can be high even for features that are not predictive of the target variable. 

## Insights
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/67ad9b54-d851-445c-9112-42601c98c386)

Our analysis revealed seven predictive variables consistently ranked within the top 10 across all models. These features fall into three key thematic areas‚Äîeach of which has significant implications for transit safety planning and intervention strategies.

### 1. Driving Behavior
#### What We Found:
Indicators such as operator speed, braking patterns, and historical incident involvement emerged as highly predictive of major safety events.

#### Why It Matters:
Driving behavior plays a crucial role in transit safety. These findings suggest the use of proactive tools like:
- Driver behavior monitoring systems
- Advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS)
- Operator re-training and performance reviews

#### Actionable Insight:
Transit agencies can implement real-time monitoring and targeted training to address unsafe driving habits before incidents occur.

### 2. Population Density
#### What We Found:
Incidents are more likely in areas with higher population density, suggesting a correlation with increased pedestrian interaction, traffic complexity, and infrastructure limitations.

#### Why It Matters:
Urban environments require tailored safety strategies that address potential issues such as:
- Congestion management
- Pedestrian safety infrastructure
- Vehicle maneuverability and visibility

#### Actionable Insight:
City planners and transit authorities should prioritize high-density corridors for safety upgrades and risk-mitigation technologies.

### 3. Time and Day of the Week
#### What We Found:
The timing of incidents‚Äîby hour, day, and possibly season‚Äîwas a significant predictor of event likelihood.

#### Why It Matters:
Certain time periods, such as weekday rush hours or late-night shifts, may coincide with increased fatigue, traffic volume, or environmental risks.

#### Actionable Insight:
Transit agencies can consider deploying time-aware risk management strategies, such as:
- Adjusting driver schedules to avoid fatigue
- Increasing oversight during known high-risk periods
- Strategically scheduling vehicle maintenance and inspections

### Strategic Implications for Transit Safety
These insights move us beyond surface-level correlations and toward actionable, data-informed safety planning. They suggest that transit agencies, city planners, and public safety organizations can:
- Target high-risk behaviors through training and technology
- Focus infrastructure investments in dense, complex transit zones
- Optimize safety resource deployment based on predictive temporal trends
Ultimately, this approach enables proactive prevention rather than reactive response‚Äîimproving safety outcomes for both transit operators and the communities they serve.
