## 📚 Project Overview

This repository contains an exploratory data analysis project on the **Major Safety Events** dataset from [data.transportation.gov](https://data.transportation.gov/Public-Transit/Major-Safety-Events/9ivb-8ae9/about_data). Our goal is to explore and analyze public transit safety incidents, uncover patterns, and build predictive models.

### 🔍 Research Questions

- **Regression:**  
  Do factors like time of day, weather conditions, and type of transit service predict the severity of safety incidents (e.g., number of injuries or fatalities)?

- **Classification:**  
  What factors are most predictive of a major safety incident occurring?

## 📋 Task List & Workflow

1. **Data Acquisition:**  
   - Download and inspect the dataset from the [source](https://data.transportation.gov/Public-Transit/Major-Safety-Events/9ivb-8ae9/about_data).

2. **Data Cleaning:**  
   - Handle missing values, data inconsistencies, and convert data types.
   - Remove or impute outliers.

3. **Data Processing & Feature Engineering:**  
   - Extract relevant features (e.g., time of day, weather conditions, transit type).
   - Create new variables to capture trends and patterns.

4. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**  
   - Generate descriptive statistics.
   - Visualize data distributions, correlations, and trends using graphs and charts.

5. **Model Building:**  
   - **Regression Models:** Predict the severity of incidents.
   - **Classification Models:** Identify key factors predicting major safety incidents.

6. **Model Fine Tuning & Evaluation:**  
   - Apply cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning.
   - Evaluate model performance using appropriate metrics.

7. **Visualization & Reporting:**  
   - Create informative visualizations.
   - Summarize findings and recommend further research directions.
