## üìö Project Overview

This project seeks to uncover the key predictors of major safety incidents that occur in the US. Our goal is to support data-driven decisions for stakeholders such as Public Safety Organizations, Transit Authorities, and City Planners by identifying patterns and risk factors that contribute to serious safety events.

### üîç Research Questions
What factors are most predictive of a major safety incident occurring?

We will use classification modeling to assess which variables are most indicative of major incidents, and may also explore regression techniques to understand the severity or frequency of incidents, depending on time and data availability. Techniques like Principal Component Analysis (PCA) will help with dimensionality reduction and model efficiency. The dataset that will be used to train this model is a major safety event that is provided by the US Department of Transportation with events from 2014-2024.

#### Objectives
- Identify critical factors leading to major safety incidents
- Inform safety improvements and resource deployment
- Support planning to minimize transit disruptions and improve public safety

#### Assumptions & Risks
- Dataset has sufficient quality and structure to train accurate models
- Risk of incomplete or missing data that could affect predictive accuracy
- No unstructured data is currently being processed that could enhance the model

## Data Description ##
This dataset consolidates transit-safety reports from multiple agencies. Each record captures essential details such as date, time, location, involved vehicles, environmental conditions, and the severity of injuries and fatalities. Combining these data points offers a comprehensive view of transit incidents and provides opportunities for analysis on vehicle operations, safety measures, passenger risk, and other critical factors that can inform decision-making and research on transit system improvements.

## Methodology

## Findings
Extra Trees outperformed Bagging Classifier and Random Forest, likely due to its more reliable feature selection and ability to avoid overfitting. Extra Trees achieved the highest ROC-AUC score (0.87) compared to 0.81 for the Bagging Classifier and Random Forest 0.67. This stronger performance may be attributed to Extra Trees‚Äô randomized split selection strategy which tends to reduce variance and overfitting particularly with complex data or imbalance datasets. Random Forest has the lowest ROC-AUC score of the three models, likely due to overfitting or its inability to address the dataset‚Äôs complexity.

The differences in feature importance across the models arise in how they handle feature selection, data complexity, correlated features and overfitting.

Extra Trees (‚ÄúExtremely Randomized Trees‚Äù) selects both features and split thresholds at random. This additional randomness lowers variance. This often results in a more balanced and less biased distribution of feature importance, helping uncover predictive features that other models may overlook
Random Forest builds trees using random subsets of features at each split which can lead to overemphasis on correlated features. It is more sensitive to feature redundancy and my prioritize less informative features due to randomness in feature selection
Bagging Classifier trains decision trees on different bootstrap samples, typically using all features at each split (unless otherwise specified). This results in more stable feature importance by producing more correlated trees. We tuned the Bagging Classifier using a grid search and applied class_weight = ‚Äòbalanced‚Äô in the base estimator to address the datasets‚Äô imbalance (with only ~5% of samples belonging to the minority class). Stratified sampling was used during cross-validation to maintain class proportions throughout training and evaluation - mitigating bias towards the majority class

Imbalanced settings, Extra Trees may provide more robust performance by identifying stronger predictors for the minority class. While Bagging and Random Forest can perform well, they are more prone to bias towards the majority class unless corrective measures (like class weights or resampling) are applied.
	
When discussing feature importance, impurity-based models (used by the three in our project) can be biased, particularly in the case of irrelevant or correlated features. As an alternative, permutation importance could be used to evaluate feature importance. It evaluates the decrease in a model‚Äôs importance when a feature‚Äôs values are randomly shuffled - it is less prone to biases caused by impurity-based methods in models. Importance derived from impurity-based methods can be high even for features that are not predictive of the target variable.
